# Workbench
## A suite of production‑grade tools for designers and production artists
Workbench is a growing collection of utilities built to support the real workflows behind brand systems, digital production, and high‑volume asset creation. Each tool reflects decades of hands‑on experience in design operations, print and digital production, and the practical realities of delivering assets at scale.
This repository serves as the foundation for the Workbench suite, housing shared logic, individual modules, and the evolving architecture that ties them together.

### Workbench is built on a few core principles:
- Production‑first — tools must reflect real‑world constraints, not theoretical ones
- Consistency over cleverness — predictable, repeatable results matter more than novelty
- Shared logic — modules draw from a common foundation to ensure accuracy and alignment
- Designer‑friendly — interfaces stay clear, minimal, and focused on the task at hand
- Scalable — each tool stands alone but integrates cleanly into the larger system
This suite is designed to support the workflows that studios, agencies, and production teams rely on every day.

### Current Modules
#### On-screen minimum size testing for browsers and apps
A browser‑accurate rendering environment for validating logo legibility across densities, backgrounds, and usage contexts. Built for teams who need consistent, production‑safe minimum‑size recommendations without guesswork.
More modules will be added as the suite expands.

### Roadmap
Workbench will grow into a multi‑tool environment, including modules for:
- Initial directory structuring, creation, and updating
- Color exploration, accessibility, and validation
- Adobe Illustrator integration and workflows
